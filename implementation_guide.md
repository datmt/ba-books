---

## EXAMPLE QUALITY STANDARDS

### BAD Example:
> "The stakeholder wanted a new feature. The BA asked questions and documented the requirement."

**Problems**: 
- Too generic
- No details
- Doesn't show process
- Not instructive

### GOOD Example:
> "During the weekly project meeting, Sarah (Product Owner) mentioned, 'Our call center is getting complaints that customers can't track their orders without calling us.'
>
> Instead of immediately writing a requirement, Alex (the BA) asked, 'How many calls are you getting about this?' Sarah checked her notes: 'About 50 per day, taking 3-5 minutes each.'
>
> Alex calculated quickly: 'That's 4-5 hours of call center time daily. What information do customers usually need?' Sarah explained they want to know if the order shipped, when it will arrive, and the tracking number if available.
>
> Alex then asked, 'Are customers logged in when they call, or do they have order numbers handy?' This revealed that customers usually had their email confirmation but weren't always logged in to the website.
>
> From this conversation, Alex drafted: 'The system shall allow customers to view order status by entering their order number and email address, without requiring login, displaying current fulfillment status, estimated delivery date, and carrier tracking number when available.'
>
> This approach saved the call center 20-25 hours per week while giving customers the self-service option they wanted."

**Why it's good**:
- Specific names and numbers
- Shows thought process
- Includes dialogue
- Demonstrates technique
- Reveals impact

## SAMPLE EXTENDED EXAMPLE FORMAT

Here's how to write the "Real Example" section:

```markdown
## Real Example: The Dashboard That Nobody Used

### The Situation

DataCorp's executives had requested an executive dashboard six months ago. The development team built exactly what was specified in the requirements document: 15 different reports, 47 metrics, data updated nightly, and a sophisticated filtering system.

Launch day arrived. The developers were proud. The project manager was relieved to finish on time. But three months later, the VP of Operations mentioned to Alex (the BA) in passing, "You know, I never look at that dashboard we built."

Alex investigated and discovered that almost no executives were using it. The project had cost $200,000 and 6 months of effort. What went wrong?

### What Actually Happened

Alex reviewed the original requirements session. The executives had been gathered for one 60-minute meeting. The facilitator asked, "What do you want to see on the dashboard?" The executives threw out ideas:

"Revenue trends!"
"Customer satisfaction scores!"
"Employee headcount!"
"Inventory turnover!"

The BA (not Alex—this was before Alex's time) diligently documented every metric mentioned. Nobody asked:
- How will you actually use this?
- What decisions will this information support?
- How often do you need this information?
- What's the story you're trying to tell?

The result? A dashboard with everything and therefore nothing. It was overwhelming, unfocused, and didn't answer any specific business question.

### The Analysis Phase

Alex scheduled individual 30-minute conversations with five key executives:

**With the CFO**:
Alex: "Tell me about a decision you made last month where better data would have helped."
CFO: "Well, we were deciding whether to expand the Denver warehouse. I needed to see the cost per order by region and shipping times, but I had to pull together three different reports manually."

**With the VP of Sales**:
Alex: "When you check our numbers, what are you hoping to learn?"
VP Sales: "I want to quickly see if we're on track for quarterly targets. If we're off, I need to know which sales team or which product line is underperforming so I can focus coaching there."

**With the COO**:
Alex: "The dashboard has 47 different metrics. Which ones would make you take action?"
COO: "Honestly? I just want to see if anything is broken. Like, is on-time delivery dropping? Is customer satisfaction falling? Are costs spiking? If everything's green, I don't need details. If something's red, then I'll dig in."

### The Key Insight

Alex realized executives didn't want 47 metrics—they wanted answers to about 5 key questions:
1. Are we hitting our financial targets?
2. Are customers happy?
3. Are operations running smoothly?
4. Where are the problems?
5. What needs my attention today?

### The Redesign

Alex created a one-page prototype showing:
- Top: Red/Yellow/Green status for the 5 key areas
- Middle: Only metrics that were "Yellow" or "Red"
- Bottom: Three trends the executive should know about this week

Each metric linked to more detail, but the initial view took 10 seconds to scan and immediately showed what needed attention.

### Validation Before Building

Before writing a single line of code, Alex:
1. Created paper mockups and walked through them with each executive
2. Asked: "If you saw this on Monday morning, would you actually look at it?"
3. Tested the language: "Does 'on-time delivery rate' mean what you think it means?"
4. Confirmed the thresholds: "Is 95% good or concerning for customer satisfaction?"

The executives suggested changes:
- Move the trends to the top (that's what they'd look at first)
- Add a "What's changed since last week" section
- Make the status indicators bigger and more obvious
- Remove jargon from labels

### The Outcome

The redesigned dashboard:
- Took 3 weeks to build (vs. 6 months)
- Cost $15,000 (vs. $200,000)
- Was checked by executives 4.3 times per week on average
- Led to faster responses to problems
- Actually got used

### Your Turn to Analyze

1. What requirements gathering mistakes were made initially?
2. How did Alex's approach differ?
3. What techniques did Alex use that weren't used before?
4. How could this failure have been prevented?
5. What would you have done differently?

### The Lessons

**Lesson 1**: More requirements ≠ better requirements
The original 47 metrics weren't wrong, but they weren't useful. Quality trumps quantity.

**Lesson 2**: Understand the job-to-be-done
Executives don't want dashboards—they want to make better decisions faster. Start with the decision, then identify the data.

**Lesson 3**: One group session ≠ complete requirements
Individual conversations revealed what the group session missed. Different stakeholders have different needs.

**Lesson 4**: Validate early with realistic prototypes
Paper mockups prevented building the wrong thing. 3 days of prototyping saved 6 months of development.

**Lesson 5**: Watch for agreement without commitment
Everyone in that original meeting agreed, but nobody was enthusiastic. That's a red flag.

### What This Means for You

As a junior BA, you'll face pressure to:
- Document what stakeholders say
- Move quickly to development
- Get sign-off and move on

But your job is to:
- Understand what stakeholders actually need
- Validate before building
- Ensure value will be delivered

Sometimes that means slowing down to speed up. Alex spent 3 extra weeks on requirements and saved 5 months of development.

That's the power of good business analysis.

```

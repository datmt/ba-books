== Requirements Quality Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate every requirement you write.

[cols="1,3,1", options="header"]
.Requirement Quality Checklist
|===
|Criterion |What to Check |✓

|**Clear**
|Can anyone read it and understand exactly what's needed?
|☐

|**Concise**
|Is it as brief as possible while staying complete?
|☐

|**Testable**
|Could someone create a test case to verify this?
|☐

|**Feasible**
|Is it technically and practically possible?
|☐

|**Necessary**
|Does it support a real business need?
|☐

|**Unambiguous**
|Could it be interpreted only one way?
|☐

|**Consistent**
|Does it align with other requirements?
|☐

|**Traceable**
|Can we connect it to business objectives?
|☐

|**Prioritized**
|Is its importance level clear?
|☐

|**Complete**
|Is all necessary information included?
|☐

=== Red Flags in Requirements

Watch for these danger signs:

* Words like "flexible," "user-friendly," "fast," "efficient" without specifics
* "And/or" constructions
* Negative requirements ("shall not")
* Multiple requirements in one statement
* Missing actors (who performs this?)
* Vague quantities ("some," "most," "approximately")

    B --> C[Focused Questions<br/>'Which of these...?']

Start wide, narrow progressively.

=== Essential Question Starters

[cols="2,3,3", options="header"]
.BA Question Toolkit
|===
|Question Type |Example |When to Use

|**Context**
|"Tell me about your typical day..."
|Opening conversations, understanding environment

|**Problem**
|"What's not working today?"
|Identifying pain points

|**Impact**
|"How does this affect your work?"
|Quantifying importance

|**Root Cause**
|"Why does that happen?"
|Digging deeper (5 Whys)

|**Frequency**
|"How often does this occur?"
|Understanding scale

|**Scope**
|"Who else experiences this?"
|Identifying stakeholders

|**Priority**
|"What happens if we don't fix this?"
|Setting priorities

|**Vision**
|"What would ideal look like?"
|Future state thinking

|**Constraints**
|"What can't change?"
|Understanding boundaries

|**Validation**
|"So what I hear you saying is..."
|Confirming understanding
|===

=== The 5 Whys Technique

[example]
.The 5 Whys in Action
====
**Problem:** Customers complain about slow shipping

1. *Why?* Orders take 3-5 days to ship +
   → Why? Warehouse processes orders once daily

2. *Why?* Why only once daily? +
   → Why? System batch job runs at midnight

3. *Why?* Why a batch job? +
   → Why? Legacy system limitation

4. *Why?* Why not update the system? +
   → Why? IT resources focused elsewhere

5. *Why?* Why are they focused elsewhere? +
   → Why? No business case for warehouse system

**Root Cause:** No business case demonstrating ROI of warehouse system upgrade

**Real Solution:** Build business case (not just "process orders faster")

[TIP]
====
Print these quick reference guides and keep them handy during your first few projects. They'll become second nature over time, but having them accessible reduces cognitive load when you're learning.
